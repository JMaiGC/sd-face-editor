# Face Editor
Face Editor for Stable Diffusion.
It can be used to repair broken faces in images generated by Stable Diffusion.

![example](./images/image-01.jpg)

This is a [extension](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Extensions) of [AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).

This software improves facial images in these features:
- txt2img
- img2img
- batch processing (batch count / batch size)
- img2img Batch

## Setup
1. Open the "Extensions" tab then the "Install from URL" tab.
2. Enter "https://github.com/ototadana/sd-face-editor.git" in the "URL of the extension's git repository" field.
   ![Install from URL](./images/setup-01.png)
3. Click the "Install" button and wait for the "Installed into /home/ototadana/stable-diffusion-webui/extensions/sd-face-editor. Use Installed tab to restart." message to appear.
4. Go to "Installed" tab and click "Apply and restart UI".


## Usage
1. Click "Face Editor" and check **"Enabled"**.
   ![Check Enabled](./images/usage-01.png)
2. Then enter the prompts as usual and click the "Generate" button to modify the faces in the generated images.
   ![Result](./images/usage-02.png)
3. If you are not satisfied with the results, adjust the [parameters](#parameters) and rerun. see [Tips](#tips).


## Tips
### Contour discomfort
If you feel uncomfortable with the facial contours, try increasing the **"Mask size"** value. This discomfort often occurs when the face is not facing straight ahead.

![Mask size](./images/tips-02.jpg)

If the forelock interferes with rendering the face properly, generally, selecting "Hair" from **"Affected areas"** results in a more natural image.

![Affected ares - UI](./images/tips-08.png)

This setting modifies the mask area as illustrated below: 

![Affected ares - Mask images](./images/tips-07.jpg)

### When multiple faces are close together
When multiple faces are close together, one face may collapse under the influence of the other.
In such cases, enable **"Use minimal area (for close faces)"**.

![Use minimal area for close faces](./images/tips-04.png)

---
### Change facial expression
Use **"Prompt for face"** option if you want to change the facial expression.

![Prompt for face](./images/tips-03.jpg)

#### Individual instructions for multiple faces
![Individual instructions for multiple faces](./images/tips-05.jpg)

Faces can be individually directed with prompts separated by `||` (two vertical lines).

![Individual instructions for multiple faces - screen shot](./images/tips-06.png)

- Each prompt is applied to the faces on the image in order from left to right.
- The number of prompts does not have to match the number of faces to work.
- If you write the string `@@`, the normal prompts (written at the top of the screen) will be expanded at that position.
- If you are using the [Wildcards Extension](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards), you can use the `__name__` syntax and the text file in the directory of the wildcards extension as well as the normal prompts.

### Fixing images that already exist
If you wish to modify the face of an already existing image instead of creating a new one, follow these steps:

1. Open the image to be edited in the img2img tab
   It is recommended that you use the same settings (prompt, sampling steps and method, seed, etc.) as for the original image. 
   So, it is a good idea to start with the **PNG Info** tab.
   1. Click **PNG Info** tab.
   2. Upload the image to be edited.
   3. Click **Send to img2img** button.
2. Set the value of **"Denoising strength"** of img2img to `0`. This setting is good for preventing changes to areas other than the faces and for reducing processing time.
3. Click "Face Editor" and check "Enabled".
4. Then, set the desired parameters and click the Generate button.

## Parameters
### Basic Options
##### Workflow
Select a workflow. For more detailed information, please refer to the [Workflow Editor](#workflow-editor) section.

##### Use minimal area (for close faces)
When pasting the generated image to its original location, the rectangle of the detected face area is used. If this option is not enabled, the generated image itself is pasted. In other words, enabling this option applies a smaller face image, while disabling it applies a larger face image.

##### Save original image
This option allows you to save the original, unmodified image.

##### Show original image
This option allows you to display the original, unmodified image.

##### Show intermediate steps
This option enables the display of images that depict detected faces and masks.
If the generated image is unnatural, enabling it may reveal the cause.

##### Prompt for face
Prompt for generating a new face.
If this parameter is not specified, the prompt entered at the top of the screen is used.

For more information, please see: [here](#change-facial-expression).


##### Mask size (0-64)
Size of the mask area when inpainting to blend the new face with the whole image.

<details>
<summary>Show sample images</summary>

**size: 0**
![mask size 0](./images/mask-00.jpg)

**size: 10**
![mask size 10](./images/mask-10.jpg)

**size: 20**
![mask size 20](./images/mask-20.jpg)
</details>


##### Mask blur (0-64)
Size of the blur area when inpainting to blend the new face with the whole image.


---
### Advanced Options
#### Step 1. Face Detection
##### Maximum number of faces to detect (1-20)
Use this parameter when you want to reduce the number of faces to be detected.
If more faces are found than the number set here, the smaller faces will be ignored.

##### Face detection confidence (0.7-1.0)
Confidence threshold for face detection. Set a lower value if you want to detect more faces.

#### Step 2. Crop and Resize the Faces
##### Face margin (1.0-2.0)
Specify the size of the margin for face cropping by magnification.

If other parameters are exactly the same but this value is different, the atmosphere of the new face created will be different.

</details>


##### Size of the face when recreating 
Specifies one side of the image size when creating a face image. Normally, there should be no need to change this from the default value (512), but you may see interesting changes if you do.

##### Ignore faces larger than specified size
Ignore if the size of the detected face is larger than the size specified in "Size of the face when recreating".

For more information, please see: [here](https://github.com/ototadana/sd-face-editor/issues/65).

#### Step 3. Recreate the Faces
##### Denoising strength for face images (0.1-0.8)
Denoising strength for generating a new face.
If the value is too small, facial collapse cannot be corrected, but if it is too large, it is difficult to blend with the entire image.

<details>
<summary>Show sample images</summary>

**strength: 0.4**
![strength 0.4](./images/deno-4.jpg)

**strength: 0.6**
![strength 0.6](./images/deno-6.jpg)

**strength: 0.8**
![strength 0.8](./images/deno-8.jpg)
</details>


#### Step 4. Paste the Faces
##### Apply inside mask only
Paste an image cut out in the shape of a face instead of a square image.

For more information, please see: [here](https://github.com/ototadana/sd-face-editor/issues/33).

#### Step 5. Blend the entire image
##### Denoising strength for the entire image (0.0-1.0)
Denoising strength when inpainting to blend the new face with the whole image.
If the border lines are too prominent, increase this value.


## Workflow Editor
Workflow Editor is where you can customize and experiment with various options beyond just the standard settings. 

- The editor allows you to select from a variety of implementations, each offering unique behaviors compared to the default settings.
- It provides a platform for freely combining these implementations, enabling you to optimize the workflow according to your needs.
- Within this workflow, you will define a combination of three components: the "Face Detector" for identifying faces within an image, the "Face Processor" for adjusting the detected faces, and the "Mask Generator" for integrating the processed faces back into the original image.
- As you experiment with different settings, ensure to activate the "Show intermediate steps" option. This allows you to understand precisely the impact of each modification.

### Workflow Components (Inferencers)
Let's delve into the concept of "Workflow Components", or "inferencers" as they are referred to in the software implementation. These constitute the building blocks of your custom workflow, with a selection available for use. Some are tried and tested, while others offer a more experimental approachâ€”feel free to explore and determine what best fits your requirements. As development continues and new components are added, the range of choices will naturally expand. Furthermore, if you are inclined towards customization, there's the opportunity to create your own component.

#### Face Detector
Select a model or algorithm to be used for face detection.

- [RetinaFace](https://github.com/xinntao/facexlib/blob/master/facexlib/detection/__init__.py) : This face detector is used by default and is designed to accurately detect faces in various conditions.
- [lbpcascade_animeface](https://github.com/nagadomi/lbpcascade_animeface) : This face detector is designed specifically for anime/manga faces.
- [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics): This detector utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) system for real-time object detection. While not designed specifically for face detection, it can be used to detect other objects of interest in addition to faces.

  YoloDetector takes the following parameters which can be specified in the 'params' of the JSON configuration:

  - `path`: (string, optional): The path to the pre-trained model file. This, or a combination of `repo_id` and `filename`, is required.
  - `repo_id`: (string, optional): The repository ID where the pre-trained model is stored. If this, along with `filename`, is provided, the model will be downloaded from the Hugging Face Model Hub.
  - `filename`: (string, optional): The name of the file in the repository. To be used with `repo_id`.
  - `conf`: (float, optional, default: 0.5): The confidence threshold for object detection.

  Note: If `repo_id` and `filename` are specified, the model path will be retrieved from the Hugging Face Model Hub.

#### Face Processor
Choose an algorithm or method to process the detected faces.

- `img2img`: This is the default implementation that enhances enlarged face images using img2img.
- `Blur`: This face processor applies a Gaussian blur to the detected face region. The intensity of the blur can be specified using the `radius` parameter in the 'params' of the JSON configuration. The larger the radius, the more intense the blur effect.

  Blur takes the following parameter which can be specified in the 'params' of the JSON configuration:

  - `radius`: (integer, optional, default: 20): The radius of the Gaussian blur filter. 
- `NoOp`: This face processor does not apply any processing to the detected faces. It can be used when no face enhancement or modification is desired, and only detection or other aspects of the workflow are needed.


#### Mask Generator
Choose a model or algorithm for generating masks.

- [BiSeNet](https://github.com/xinntao/facexlib/blob/master/facexlib/parsing/__init__.py) : This operates as the default Mask Generator.
- `Ellipse`: This option draws an ellipse around the detected face region to generate a mask.
- `Rect`: This is a simplistic implementation that uses the detected face region as a direct mask.
- `NoMask`: This option generates a "mask" that is simply an all-white image of the same size as the input face image. It essentially does not mask any part of the image and can be used in scenarios where no masking is desired.


### Workflow JSON Reference

- `face_detector` (string or object, required): The face detector component to be used in the workflow.
  - When specified as a string, it is considered as the `name` of the face detector implementation.
  - When specified as an object:
    - `name` (string, required): The name of the face detector implementation.
    - `params` (object, optional): Parameters for the component, represented as key-value pairs.
- `rules` (array or object, required): One or more rules to be applied.
  - Each rule can be an object that consists of `when` and `then`:
    - `when` (object, optional): The condition for the rule.
      - `tag` (string, optional): A tag corresponding to the type of face detected by the face detector.
      - `criteria` (string, optional): This determines which faces will be processed, based on position or size. Available options include 'left', 'right', 'center', 'top', 'middle', 'bottom', 'small', 'large', and 'all'.
    - `num` (integer, optional): The maximum number of faces to be processed that match the specified criteria. If `num` is not specified, it is considered as 1. For example, if `criteria` is 'left' and `num` is not specified, then only the leftmost face will be processed. If `criteria` is 'left' and `num` is 2, then the two leftmost faces will be processed.
    - `then` (object or array of objects, required): The job or list of jobs to be executed if the `when` condition is met.
      - Each job is an object with the following properties:
        - `face_processor` (object or string, required): The face processor component to be used in the job.
          - When specified as a string, it is considered as the `name` of the face processor implementation.
          - When specified as an object:
            - `name` (string, required): The name of the face processor implementation.
            - `params` (object, optional): Parameters for the component, represented as key-value pairs.
        - `mask_generator` (object or string, required): The mask generator component to be used in the job.
          - When specified as a string, it is considered as the `name` of the mask generator implementation.
          - When specified as an object:
            - `name` (string,  required): The name of the mask generator implementation.
            - `params` (object, optional): Parameters for the component, represented as key-value pairs.
  
Rules are processed in the order they are specified. Once a face is processed by a rule, it will not be processed by subsequent rules. The last rule can be specified with `then` only (i.e., without `when`), which will process all faces that have not been processed by previous rules.


## API
If you want to use this script as an extension (alwayson_scripts) in the [API](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/API), specify **"face editor ex"** as the script name as follows:

```
   "alwayson_scripts": {
      "face editor ex": {
         "args": [{"prompt_for_face": "smile"}]
      },
```

By specifying an **object** as the first argument of args as above, parameters can be specified by keywords. We recommend this approach as it can minimize the impact of modifications to the software. If you use a script instead of an extension, you can also specify parameters in the same way as follows:

```
   "script_name": "face editor",
   "script_args": [{"prompt_for_face": "smile"}],
```

- See [source code](https://github.com/ototadana/sd-face-editor/blob/main/scripts/entities/option.py) for available keywords.
